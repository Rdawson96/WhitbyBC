                    <h2>Reduce plastic consumption</h2>
                    <p>The production of plastic contributes to air pollution, and discarded plastic items can take
                        hundreds
                        of years to
                        decompose. By reducing our plastic usage, we can decrease both the demand for plastic and the
                        amount
                        of plastic
                        waste
                        that ends up in our oceans. This can be as simple as using a reusable water bottle instead of
                        buying
                        bottled water,
                        or
                        bringing your own bags to the grocery store instead of using the store's plastic bags.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>Make Sure to recycle properly</h2>
                    <p>While recycling is not a cure-all solution, it can help reduce the amount of new plastic being
                        produced. However, it's
                        important to recycle properly, as incorrect recycling can lead to contamination, making the
                        entire
                        batch of recyclables
                        unprocessable. Make sure to clean out your recyclables before putting them in the bin, and check
                        your local recycling
                        guidelines to see what types of plastic are accepted.</p>

                    <h2>Spread awareness</h2>
                    <p>Many people are unaware of the extent of plastic pollution and its impact on marine life. By
                        educating others, you can
                        help spread awareness and inspire others to take action. This could be through social media,
                        local
                        community meetings,
                        schools, or even casual conversations with friends and family.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>Support Sustainable Brands</h2>
                    <p>Another effective way to combat plastic pollution is by supporting businesses that prioritize
                        sustainability. Many
                        companies are now offering products with minimal or no plastic packaging, or products made from
                        recycled or
                        biodegradable materials. By choosing to buy from these companies, you're not only reducing your
                        own plastic footprint,
                        but also encouraging more businesses to adopt sustainable practices</p>
