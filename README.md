#### Validation Errors

##### HTML

- Index Page
  - The W3C Markup Validator found errors where I had given a href value an alt attribute on the index page. I was able to delete this.
  - The W3C Markup Validator also found multiple stray end div tags that I deleted from the code.
  - The last error the validator found was that I had used a button as a descendent of an a element. I amended this by removing the button and applying css styling to the a attribute
  - [image of Index page validation errors](assets/readme-images/index-page-errors.png)
- Volunteer Page
  - The W3C Markup Validator found an error in the use of a % as a measurement on the Iframe. I fixed this by applying an ID and using a percentage through the CSS file.

### Accessibility

Ensuring that our website is accessible to all users, regardless of their abilities or disabilities, is a priority for us. We strive to follow best practices to make our content usable by a wide audience. Here are some of the steps we have taken to enhance accessibility:

#### 1. Lighthouse testing

Light house in Chrome Dev tools was used to confirm the colors of the site are easy to read and easily accessible.

- Lighthouse reports
- Index page
  - [Index page lighthouse report](assets/readme-images/index-lighthouse-test.png)
- Save the world page
  - [Save the World page lighthouse report](assets/readme-images/save-the-world-lighthouse-test.png)
- Volunteer page
  - [Volunteer page lighthouse report](assets/readme-images/volunteer-lighthouse-test.png)
  - The performance could be improved by further reducing the image size.

#### 2. Semantic HTML

Semantic HTML tags were used to provide a clear and meaningful structure to the webiste content. This helps screen readers and other assistive technologies interpret and convey information accurately.

#### 3. ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)

ARIA attributes were utilised on links to enhance the accessibility of the site allowing for screen readers to accurately pick up information.

#### 4. Contrast and Readability

[Coolers Contrast Checker](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/112a46-acc8e5)was used to ensure  sufficient contrast in colors chosen to make the content readable for users with visual impairments.

#### 5. Alt Text for Images

All images on the website include descriptive alternative text (alt text). This helps users with visual impairments understand the content and context of images even if they cannot see them.

#### 6. Responsive Design

The website is responsive, providing a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes. This benefits users with different abilities and ensures a consistent and accessible user experience.
