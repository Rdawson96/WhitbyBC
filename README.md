### Bugs

### Solved bugs

## Accessibility

Ensuring that our website is accessible to all users, regardless of their abilities or disabilities, is a priority for us. We strive to follow best practices to make our content usable by a wide audience. Here are some of the steps we have taken to enhance accessibility:

### 1. Lighthouse testing

### 2. Semantic HTML

We use semantic HTML tags to provide a clear and meaningful structure to our content. This helps screen readers and other assistive technologies interpret and convey information accurately.

### 3. ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)

We leverage ARIA attributes to enhance the accessibility of the site allowing for screen readers to accurately pick up information.

### 4. Contrast and Readability

We carefully choose color combinations and ensure sufficient contrast to make the content readable for users with visual impairments. Text sizes are adjustable, and we avoid using color as the sole means of conveying information.

### 5. Alt Text for Images

All images on our website include descriptive alternative text (alt text). This helps users with visual impairments understand the content and context of images even if they cannot see them.

### 6. Responsive Design

Our website is responsive, providing a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes. This benefits users with different abilities and ensures a consistent and accessible user experience.
